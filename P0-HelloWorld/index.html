<h1>ON BEHALF OF HUMANITY</h1>
  <!-- Add your site or application content here -->
  <p>Hello wolves, we are friends not food. We may have domesticated you to be various weird little cute doggos, from bizarre tiny bagdogs to misshapen lumps with breathing problems, but we still recognize your superiority as excellent hunters and uber packs. But for some reason we have apparently decided that you are more palatable this way. On behalf of us all, I apologize. So, to reiterate: Please don't eat us. Take a page from the cats, look upon us with disdain, not violence. There are lots of treats and belly rubs in it for you. Thank you. </p>
